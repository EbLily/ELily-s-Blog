# My Personal Blog Using Web APIs

## My Task

In this challenge, I created a two-page website where users will input and view blog posts. It includes building a content form, dynamically rendering blog posts, and implementing a light/dark mode toggle. 

## User Story
As a developer student, I created this blog to showcase my thoughts and experiences.
